##### 5d branch

This branch contains the necessary code to process angle-averaged 3D CCSN simulation data and compare it with 1D simulation data. The hammer.py script conducts a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation on five parameters using the Affine-Invariant MCMC Ensemble Sampler (see hdfm.io/emcee/current for details).
The settings for running the programs are contained in the settings.py file. Their uses are as follows:
